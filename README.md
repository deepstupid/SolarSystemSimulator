# SolarSystemSimulator
Solar System Simulator written in Java. Positions and velocities of Solar System bodies and Spacecraft are continuously updated using
either Newton mechanics or General Relativity. Initial positions and velocities are obtained from Nasa JPL's ephemerides. 
While simulating, both simulated positions and ephemeris data are visualised for comparison. Source code is made publicly
availaible under the MIT licence.
